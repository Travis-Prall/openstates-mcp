## üì¶ Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.12+
- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for dependency management
- Internet connection for OpenStates API access

### Install with uv

```bash
# Clone the repository
 git clone <repository-url>
 cd OpenStates

# Install dependencies
 uv sync

# Activate the environment (optional)
 uv shell
```

### Environment Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```bash
OPENSTATES_BASE_URL=https://v3.openstates.org
OPENSTATES_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
OPENSTATES_TIMEOUT=30
OPENSTATES_LOG_LEVEL=INFO
OPENSTATES_RATE_LIMIT=50
OPENSTATES_CACHE_TTL=300
OPENSTATES_DEBUG=false
MCP_PORT=8785
```

### Running the Server

The server now runs with streamable-http transport by default:

```bash
uv run python -m app.server
```

This will start the server at:

- **Host**: `0.0.0.0` (accessible from external connections)
- **Port**: `8785`
- **Endpoint**: `http://localhost:8785/mcp/`

Or use the VS Code task: **Run MCP Server**

#### Connecting to the Server

When using the streamable-http transport, clients can connect to the server using:

```python
from fastmcp import Client

async with Client("http://localhost:8785/mcp/") as client:
    result = await client.call_tool("status")
    print(result)
```
